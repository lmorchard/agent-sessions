# agent-sessions — design

Captured 2026-07-23 from the originating brainstorm. This is the reasoning trail behind
the two-skill system, kept so the *why* survives.

## Origin

Burning down the [decafclaw](https://github.com/users/lmorchard/projects/6) project board
manually — pick issue → spec → plan → execute → PR → request Copilot review → address
comments → merge. Question: how to push more of that loop toward autonomy, escalating to
a human only for issues that actually need it.

## The one principle

**An agent is only as autonomous as its verifier is trustworthy.**

**Corollary (added from prior-art survey, see [prior-art.md](prior-art.md)):** trustworthy
means the *oracle itself* must be validated. "Criterion is machine-checkable" is necessary
but **not sufficient** — the check must also be *correct*, the verifier must be
**independent of the implementer**, and acceptance tests **frozen before implementation**
so the implementer can't weaken them (SWE-bench documents test-log misparsing; Anthropic
names self-verification bias). An untrustworthy green check is worse than no check.

(From Anthropic's ["Enabling Claude Code to work more autonomously"](https://www.anthropic.com/news/enabling-claude-code-to-work-more-autonomously)
and the long-running-agent research: if the agent can check its own work with a near-perfect
oracle, it can run; where the oracle is weak or missing, a human belongs.)

The manual loop already has **strong oracles in the middle** (`make check`, `make test`,
evals, Copilot review) and **weak oracles at the two ends**:
- front: *"is this issue well-specified enough to attempt unattended?"*
- back: *"is this PR safe to merge?"*

So: automate the strong-oracle middle; keep humans on the weak-oracle ends. The rest of
the design falls out of that.

## What to front-load (and what not to)

Ranked by leverage for autonomy:

1. **Verifiable acceptance criteria — the biggest lever.** A spec that says *what* to
   build defines the target; a spec that says *"done means X, and here's the check that
   proves it"* defines the **oracle**. That's what lets the loop grade itself. The
   criteria must resolve to something runnable (`test_x` passes, `make check` green, a new
   eval case), not prose a human eyeballs.
2. **Board triage / priorities** — powers *selection and throughput*, a different axis. It
   decides which issue the loop picks up and whether it's ready. Valuable, but it doesn't
   make any individual issue get built better.
3. **Pre-attached plans — weakest, mildly counterproductive.** A plan written at *filing*
   time is stale by *execution* time (the repo moved), and planning against live code is
   exactly what the model is good at doing fresh. **Generate the plan at execution time**
   (launch research subagents against current state, then compose) — don't freeze it at
   triage.

**Missing from the naive model:** the front-loaded metadata that specifically buys
autonomy is the **escalation signal**, not the plan. At triage, stamp: is this safe
unattended? (`auto-ok` vs `needs-review`), likely paths touched, rough size.

**Cost caveat:** front-loading only pays when the artifact is *reusable* (agent + Copilot
+ future-you read it) or *doubles as the verifier*. Small/mechanical issues should skip
the ceremony: one-line criterion, `auto-ok`, done. If speccing takes as long as doing,
you've moved the work earlier, not gained leverage.

## The reframe

**A good spec names its own verifier.** When you can write the acceptance criterion as a
check the loop can run, that issue is a candidate for the autonomous middle. When the only
honest test is "human decides," that's not a spec failure — it's the issue *telling you*
it belongs in `needs-review`. The criteria do double duty: power execution *and* sort
issues into autonomy tiers for free.

## The capability ladder (Claude Code, verified against docs 2026-07-23)

1. **Headless CLI** — `claude -p --bare --allowedTools "..." --output-format json`.
   `--bare` skips CLAUDE.md/hooks/MCP autodiscovery for reproducible CI (slated to become
   the `-p` default). `--permission-mode dontAsk` = locked-down mode (denies anything
   outside allow-rules). JSON output carries `total_cost_usd` + `session_id`;
   `--continue`/`--resume` chain sessions.
   [docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/headless)
2. **GitHub Actions** (`anthropics/claude-code-action@v1`) — the "runs without my laptop"
   unlock. Auto-detects `@claude` mention mode vs `prompt:` automation mode; the prompt
   form runs on *any* event including `schedule:` cron. Vertex via Workload Identity
   Federation (matters for decafclaw's multi-provider setup). Separate
   [GitHub Code Review](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/code-review) posts reviews on every
   PR with no trigger. [docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/github-actions)
3. **Agent SDK** (Python/TS) — full programmatic loop w/ hooks + subagents. **Overkill for
   decafclaw**: it's *already* an agent runtime with its own hooks/subagents/workflow
   engine. Building a second orchestrator to drive the first is redundant.
4. **Hooks** — `PreToolUse` can hard-block even under `bypassPermissions`; guardrails, not
   the primary loop.

Note on trusting research: the first-pass research subagent produced a wall of confident
detail; several specifics ("Claude Code Routines," a C-compiler blog's cost figures,
Pro/Max daily run limits, a specific CVE version) could **not** be verified and were
dropped. Distrust-and-verify is the same principle as the burndown loop, applied to the
research agent — its verifier (the human) has to be good, because unverified confident
output is exactly what weak oracles produce.

## Phased rollout (increasing autonomy, each reversible)

1. **Self-driving skill, local, human at the merge gate.** Package the manual loop as one
   command that runs spec → research → plan → execute → `make check && make test` → open
   PR with an `--allowedTools` allowlist, and *stops before merge*. Runs on-machine,
   watchable, interruptible. Lowest risk, highest immediate leverage.
2. **Scheduled GitHub Action opening draft PRs.** Same loop, no laptop required. Branch
   protection keeps merge human-gated. Second workflow triggered on Copilot review
   addresses comments.
3. **Conditional auto-merge.** Only `auto-ok` issues with all-green checks + no unresolved
   review threads. auth/data/deploy/`.github`/new-deps stay human-gated (aligns with the
   standing never-deploy-without-permission rule). Start conservative: auto-merge nothing
   until Phase 2 has earned trust.

**Safety:** avoid `--dangerously-skip-permissions` / `bypassPermissions`. Scoped
`--allowedTools` + `dontAsk` gets ~95% of the autonomy with a real floor under it.

## The two-skill system

### intake skill (grilling-derived, human-in-loop)

Lives at the weak-oracle front end. Job: turn a wishlist stub into a spec whose criteria
are runnable checks, plus an escalation tier — and emit a filable issue.

Built on Matt Pocock's [grilling skill](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/blob/main/skills/productivity/grilling/SKILL.md),
which is a near-perfect engine. Its mechanics map directly:

- **"Probe the environment for factual matters rather than asking"** = the
  research-subagents-then-plan instinct. The skill dispatches Explore/research agents to
  answer *factual* questions about the codebase (does this pattern exist? current shape?
  is there a test harness?) and spends the human's attention only on *decisions*.
- **"Provide your recommended answer alongside each question"** = kills the overhead risk.
  Inverts authoring effort: instead of "what are the acceptance criteria?" (blank page),
  the skill — having researched — *proposes* criteria as runnable checks and the human
  ratifies/corrects. Fast triage, not a dreaded form.
- **"One question at a time, walk the decision tree resolving dependencies"** = the spine:
  definition → scope boundaries → each criterion → (derived) tier.
- **"Don't act until shared understanding is confirmed"** = the human-in-loop gate.

What intake *adds* on top of grilling (the thin, opinionated layer):

1. **A fixed target schema** instead of open-ended "shared understanding" — driving toward
   *definition + verifiable criteria + escalation tier*; done when those slots are filled.
2. **Verifiability as the per-branch success test** — refuses to close a criterion while
   it's still a wish; its recommended answer is *always* a runnable check, and "how would
   you actually know?" is the standing follow-up.
3. **An output artifact** — emits the filable issue body + labels, tier *inferred* from
   whether every criterion resolved to a check (all checks → `auto-ok`; any "human decides"
   → `needs-review`).

Scope guardrail: intake is for **heavier issues only**. Small/mechanical ones skip it.

### execution skill (self-driving, autonomous middle)

Phase 1 above. Consumes a well-specified issue; runs the loop; stops at the merge gate.

### shared contract

The seam between intake's *output* and execution's *input*: the acceptance-criteria format
+ escalation labels. Design once, both read from it. (In the spirit of decafclaw's
"don't hand-maintain parallel field lists that rot in lockstep.")

## Finding (2026-07-23, later): dev-session already IS the producer/consumer core

Studied the existing `~/.claude/skills/dev-session` skill (SKILL.md + phases + references).
It already implements most of the two-skill system sketched above — not "similar to," but
*is* it. The sequel is therefore an **upgrade + orchestration layer**, not a reimplementation.

Already covered by dev-session:

| Sketched as "new" | Where it already lives |
|---|---|
| Producer/consumer split | `file` (produces spec-embedded issue) → `express` (autonomously consumes); `<!-- dev-session:spec -->` marker = the shared contract/seam |
| Research-then-plan-live | `brainstorm` documentarian substep → `research.md`; plan generated at `plan`/`express` time, never frozen at filing |
| Grilling-style interview | `brainstorm` step 3: propose best judgment + trade-offs, confirm/adjust, no open-ended Qs, multiple-choice preferred |
| Crude autonomy tier | `express` Phase 0 complexity check (pushes back on L/XL/ambiguous); feel-driven carve-out refuses autonomous execution of subjective visual work |
| Board transitions | Ready → In Progress → In Review via `references/github-projects.md` |
| Spec-readiness gate | Readiness checklist in `spec-template.md` |
| Scope proportional to complexity | `brainstorm` step 4 |

The genuine gaps — the ~20% that is actually new and high-leverage:

1. **Verifiable acceptance criteria as first-class (the core gap).** spec-template's
   "Desired end state" is *prose* (user-visible behavior, API surface); the Readiness
   checklist gates on placeholders / consistency / scope / ambiguity but **nothing requires
   each criterion to name a runnable check.** Upgrading spec-template + the readiness
   checklist to demand a runnable oracle per criterion (`test_x` passes, `make check`
   green, an eval case) is the highest-value change — and it's small. This is
   "a good spec names its own verifier" made concrete.
2. **A durable, verifiability-derived tier label** stamped at `file` time (not decided
   ad-hoc at `express` Phase 0), so a board/cron loop can *route* on it. The tier falls
   out of "did every criterion resolve to a check?" (all → `auto-ok`; any human-eyeball →
   `needs-review`).
3. **The merge gate.** `express` stops at PR-with-Copilot-addressed; merge is human.
   Conditional auto-merge by tier (all-green + no unresolved threads + `auto-ok`) is new.
4. **The board-level driver.** Nothing today *picks the next Ready issue and runs `express`
   unattended*, then advances. That orchestration (headless `claude -p` / scheduled GHA)
   is the actual "burndown loop" and sits *above* a per-issue skill.

Reframed build: (1)+(2) are **enhancements to dev-session** (spec-template, brainstorm,
readiness checklist, `file`). (3)+(4) live *above* a per-issue skill — the orchestration
bookends. So "standalone skill vs dev-session phase" resolves mostly toward *extend
dev-session*; the separate artifact is the driver + merge gate.

## Build status (2026-07-24)

Decided: **single `agent-session` skill, multi-mode dispatcher** (dev-session lineage), not
separate skills. Rationale: sidesteps the unverified cross-skill file-sharing mechanism
entirely (all refs in-dir), and the dispatcher's lazy-load means modes never co-reside, so
adding modes doesn't confound the LLM mid-phase — the only confounding risk is at the entry
boundary, mitigated by explicit mode arguments + an ask-don't-guess dispatcher. Heavy modes
fan out to subagents; the board-driver stays *above* the skill as orchestration.

Built (front-of-funnel), in `skills/agent-session/`:
- `SKILL.md` — dispatcher, context-management notes, conventions.
- `references/acceptance-criteria.md` — **the novel core**: every criterion names a runnable
  check; verifier-independence + freeze-before-implementation; concrete-test → property →
  human-judgment escalation ladder; **oracle-must-already-exist** rule; tier derivation
  (auto-ok/needs-review) + risk-gated-path override.
- `references/criteria-grammar.md` — EARS (five patterns, verified against Mavin) +
  Given-When-Then syntax reference.
- `references/spec-template.md` — criteria replace prose "desired end state"; readiness
  checklist gates on *verifiability*.
- `references/documentarian-prompt.md` — neutral negation rules for the research subagent
  (shared by intake + triage); includes the oracle-existence question.
- `phases/intake.md` — new + existing-issue (augment) modes; reduce each requirement to
  criterion+check; verify each check's oracle exists *now*; derive tier; file/update issue.
- `phases/triage.md` — batch backlog-gardening; subagents fan out to assess + draft proposed
  criteria, human ratifies in a fast pass, augment in place.

Validated:
- **intake — micro-tested AND dogfooded.** Micro-test (Sonnet, control vs treatment, 5
  reps/arm) on the criteria-gate wording: control 0/5 checkable, treatment 5/5 → wording is
  load-bearing; a 4:1 tier-split surfaced the oracle-must-exist gap, fix closed it 5/5.
  Then dogfooded end-to-end on a real issue (starnet #129) via the augment path — filed
  criteria + `auto-ok` tier back to the issue; the run surfaced + fixed two skill gaps
  (missing documentarian ref; missing oracle-verification step).
- **triage — built, NOT yet dogfooded.**

Pending (this is the next work): **execution modes** (`plan`/`execute`/`express`/`pr`)
adapted from `dev-session` + the **tiered merge gate**; then the **board-driver**
orchestration (above the skill); and a triage dogfood + an interactive-intake check of the
empty-state observation.

Testing calibration (agreed, still holds): workflow/reference skill derived from a proven
one — scaffold structurally without pressure-scenario TDD; micro-test only novel
behavior-shaping wording against a no-guidance control (5+ reps, read every match by hand);
don't add nuance clauses to a winning recipe; dogfood after building. Full pressure
scenarios deferred until there's something worth hardening.

## Resolved (was open)

- Criteria grammar → **EARS + Given-When-Then** (not invented); see `criteria-grammar.md`.
- Property middle tier → **done** (in the escalation ladder).
- dev-session edits vs. overlay → **fresh single `agent-session` skill** this repo owns.
- Prior-art → surveyed; see `prior-art.md`.

## Open questions (for the pending work)

- **Verifier-independence mechanics (move 1):** how to keep the check-author separate from
  the implementer and freeze checks before implementation, inside `execute`/`express`.
  dev-session already leans on subagent-driven execution + two-stage review — likely most of
  the way there; the job is to specialize it so the frozen acceptance checks are the gate.
- **Merge gate (move 1):** how `auto-ok` gates auto-merge — all-green required checks + no
  unresolved review threads + tier label; where the tier lives (issue label vs. spec
  frontmatter — dogfood put it in the issue body; labels not yet created in target repos).
- **Board-driver (later):** local `claude -p` loop vs. scheduled GHA; how it reads/filters
  the Ready queue by tier. Stays *above* the skill.
